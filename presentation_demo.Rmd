## Using Plotly

Personally I think it's pretty cool that plotly has a function *ggplotly()* that will let you simply pass it a ggplot object. I like to do this with '*%>%*' (piping). Here is my simple example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

(   ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = as.factor(cyl)))
    + geom_point()
    + labs(title = "mtcars")
    + labs(colour = "cylinders")
) %>% ggplotly()
```

## Plotly Demonstration

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

(   ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = as.factor(cyl)))
    + geom_point()
    + labs(title = "mtcars")
    + labs(colour = "cylinders")
) %>% ggplotly()
```
